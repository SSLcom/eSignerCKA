eSigner CKA (Cloud Key Adapter) is a Windows based application that uses the CNG interface (KSP Key Service Provider) to allow tools such as certutil.exe and signtool.exe to use the eSigner Cloud Signature Consortium (CSC)-compliant API for enterprise code signing operations. It acts like a virtual USB token and loads the code signing certs to the certificate store.
